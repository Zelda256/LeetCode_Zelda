# 63. Unique Paths II

Follow up for "Unique Paths":
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.


**For example,**

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

    [
      [0,0,0],
      [0,1,0],
      [0,0,0]
    ]

The total number of unique paths is 2.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

### 思路：
用一个矩阵path记录从grid[0][0]到grid[i][j]的可走路径数，当grid[i][j]为1时，在path[i][j]的记录为0；其余同问题62一样。

### 代码：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& Grid) {
        int row = Grid.size();
        if(row == 0 || Grid[0][0] == 1) return 0;
        int col = Grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> path;
        for(int i=0; i<row; ++i){
            path.push_back({});
            for(int j=0; j<col; ++j){
                if( Grid[i][j] == 1 ) path[i].push_back(0);
                else if( i==0 && j==0 ) path[i].push_back(1);
                else if(i == 0 && j>0) path[i].push_back(path[i][j-1]);
                else if(j == 0 && i>0) path[i].push_back(path[i-1][j]);
                else path[i].push_back(path[i][j-1] + path[i-1][j]);

            }
        }
        return path[row-1][col-1];

    }
};
```
